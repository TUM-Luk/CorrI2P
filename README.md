## CorrI2P: Deep Image-to-Point Cloud Registration via Dense Correspondence

### Data  
Here we would provide KITTI prepared.
The dataset is about 300 GB so we are trying to upload them.

### Usage
Install required lib as SO-Net or [DeepI2P](https://github.com/lijx10/DeepI2P/tree/main/models/index_max_ext).
#### Train
```
python train.py
```
#### Test
```
python eval_all.py
python cal_error_all.py
python analysis.py
```
Note: There would be lots of intermediate results, please leave enough storage space.  
  
We thank the authors of [DeepI2P](https://github.com/lijx10/DeepI2P) for their public code.
